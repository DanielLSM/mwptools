Experimental script to parse data from Frsky SPort telemetry.

I do not have a Trannis / Frsky TX; the data was provided by another
(see <https://github.com/opentx/opentx/wiki/Taranis-serial-port> for
details of TX connections).

Although it was reported that a 3D fix existed, no useful positional
data is extracted (all GPS position data fails CRC; ignoring CRC
decodes obviously incorrect data).

In future source data and black box log will hopefully become
available, for the moment there is the script and the output, which
contains on location data (alas).

E&OE. The detail encapsulated in the script has been compiled from
various internet sources; no thanks to the unhelpful, anti-free
software, proprietary attitude from Frsky.
