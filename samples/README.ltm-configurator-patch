This note applies to versions of Cleanflight the have LTM built in (either
by applying PR 1010 to a local source tree, or by default in the INAV
(navigation-rewrite) branch
<https://github.com/digitalentity/cleanflight/tree/inav-dev> and
<http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2495732>

The file /samples/ltm-configurator-patch.diff patches the Cleanflight
configurator (1.0 and above at least, tested with 1.10) to support LTM
as a telemetry option.

To apply:

$ cd <path_to_configurator>
$ patch -p1 <path_to>/mwptools/samples/ltm-configurator-patch.diff

To remove:

$ cd <path_to_configurator>
$ patch -p1 -R <path_to>/mwptools/samples/ltm-configurator-patch.diff

Prior to performing either of those action, one can add --dry-run to
patch command line to see the affect without changing anything.

Otherwise it is necessary to use the CLI to support LTM: The function
mask value of 256 is used to indicate LTM, e.g. (on soft serial 1)

serial 30 257 9600 57600 9600 57600

where the function mask of 257 (1+256) indicates MSP / CLI when
unarmed and LTM when armed. mwp will automatically switch between the
two.
