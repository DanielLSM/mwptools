mwp (and any other application that uses clutter) will die horribly
using contemporary NVIDIA proprietary video drivers (c. May / June
2015). This happens on at least Arch and Fedora 22.

This is due to a bug in clutter / nvidia.

The workaround is to set the CLUTTER_BACKEND environment variable to
x11:

$ export CLUTTER_BACKEND=x11

Doing this in /etc/environment or other globally sourced file will fix
all clutter dependent applications.
